# blender-daily-tips
Daily tips delivered right within the blender interface
*[Source code available](https://github.com/TheDuckCow/blender-daily-tips/)*

## Usage

- After enablign the addon, it should immediately auto-check for a tip in the background. If you are connected to the internet, the preferences panel (if expanded) will then show the most recent tips fetched from online
- To access the daily tip from the user interface, go to the info bar > help > daily tip. This will again launch a background thread to grab the latest tips from online. A popup should appear in the interface after the background check for tips has completed, this operation will not hang or prevent the continued use of blender while the check for tips occurs.
- You can enable auto-show tips, which will automatically check for and show you the daily tip. This will occur at most once per blender session per interval defined in user preferences, the default being 1 = 1 day = a daily tip **(note: this feature does not work quite yet, you have to manually click get daily tip).**
